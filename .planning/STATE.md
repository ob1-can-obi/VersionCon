# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04)

**Core value:** Teams collaborate on code without merge conflict pain — dependency-aware tracking means you only stop coding when changes genuinely affect what you're working on.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Presence, Chat + File-Level Conflict Notifications

## Current Position

Phase: 4 (Presence, Chat + File-Level Conflict Notifications) — EXECUTING
Plan: 5 of 11
Status: Executing Phase 4 — Plans 04-01, 04-02, 04-03, 04-06 complete (4 of 11); remaining wave-2/wave-3 plans queued
Next: Plan 04-04 (host chat/presence relay) — wave-2 in progress; PresenceMap + ChatLog now both available for SessionHost consumer.
Last activity: 2026-05-08 -- Plan 04-03 complete: PresenceMap accumulator + 8 unit tests (179 passing)

Progress: [███████░░░] 66%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 10
- Average duration: 3.8 min
- Total execution time: 0.62 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 6 | 23 min | 3.8 min |
| 04 | 4 | 15 min | 3.8 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-08 (3 min), 04-01 (6 min), 04-06 (3 min), 04-02 (4 min), 04-03 (2 min)
- Trend: steady

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Use `web-tree-sitter` (WASM) from day one — never `node-tree-sitter`. Switching later requires rewriting entire AST layer.
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Manual IP join path must be built BEFORE mDNS discovery. mDNS fails silently in VLANs and corporate/university networks.
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Stateless webview architecture — all state in extension host; webview fires `webview-ready` on mount and receives full state snapshot.
- [Pre-Phase 2]: Route drag-and-drop events through extension host to avoid VS Code 1.90+ cross-webview regression (issue #256444).
- [Plan 01-00]: Test stubs created as Wave 0 before production code — every requirement tagged in test descriptions for traceability.
- [Plan 01-01]: Added @types/node and types array to tsconfig for Node16 module resolution compatibility with test stubs.
- [Plan 01-01]: Updated .gitignore to exclude node_modules, dist, .venv, .vscode-test, and *.vsix.
- [Plan 01-02]: First authenticated member gets host role; tracked via hostMemberId for admin command authorization.
- [Plan 01-02]: SessionClient uses null-ws pattern to distinguish intentional disconnect from connection drops.
- [Plan 01-03]: Used optional chaining for bonjour-service Service.stop (type declares it as optional).
- [Plan 04-01]: Phase 4 wire types added contract-first in Wave 1 so Waves 2-4 share one canonical shape.
- [Plan 04-01]: ChatRecord.meta.affectsLocal is computed client-side only — JSDoc documents non-persistence (T-04-01-03).
- [Plan 04-01]: PresenceInfo.activeFilePath uses 'string | null' rather than 'string | undefined' so the value travels through JSON cleanly.
- [Plan 04-01]: VALID_TYPES gate test verifies T-04-01-02 mitigation — invented chat-* types are rejected at the parser layer.
- [Plan 04-06]: computeFileOverlap takes platform as injectable arg so darwin/linux/win32 branches all unit-test on any host OS.
- [Plan 04-06]: pathLib selection inside the function (path.win32 vs path.posix) decouples relative-path correctness from the runtime OS — reproducible win32 tests on macOS CI.
- [Plan 04-06]: Path normalization splits on both path.sep and backslash so synthetic win32 inputs normalize correctly when the host platform differs (deviation Rule 2 — correctness improvement, no behavior change in production).
- [Plan 04-06]: TabInputTextDiff in getOpenTabPaths includes BOTH original and modified URIs — user clearly cares about both files visible in the diff view.
- [Plan 04-02]: ChatLog mirrors PushHistory.ts pattern verbatim — same load/save/append shape, same whole-file rewrite, no .tmp+rename (atomic-rename upgrade deferred jointly with PushHistory).
- [Plan 04-02]: ChatLog.getRecords() returns chronological (oldest first), opposite of PushHistory — chat displays oldest-at-top, scrolling down to newest.
- [Plan 04-02]: truncateKeepLast100PlusActivity uses (timestamp, id.localeCompare) sort tiebreaker so equal-ms records produce deterministic output across reloads (V8 sort is unstable for ties without it).
- [Plan 04-02]: ChatLog.getRecords() returns a defensive copy ([...this.records]) so external mutation cannot corrupt the in-memory cache; worth applying retroactively to PushHistory.
- [Plan 04-02]: exportToFile honors hiddenBefore with >= boundary semantics so per-user clear-view does not leak hidden context into exports.
- [Plan 04-03]: PresenceMap is a class (not a bare Map) so Plan 04-08 (TreeProvider) has something to wrap with refresh() side effects and Plan 04-04 (host) can choose to use it or keep an inline Map — overrides RESEARCH §"PresenceMap location" advice based on Plan 04-08's needs.
- [Plan 04-03]: getSnapshot() returns Array.from(values()) defensive copy — consistent with SyncTracker.getOutOfSyncPaths() and ChatLog.getRecords() patterns; tested explicitly so the invariant survives refactors.
- [Plan 04-03]: PresenceMap is policy-agnostic — sanitization of memberId (T-04-03-01) and activeFilePath (T-04-03-03) is the caller's responsibility (Plan 04-04 and Plan 04-06); documented in upsert() JSDoc cross-referencing STRIDE threat IDs.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Cross-webview drag-and-drop VS Code 1.90+ regression (issue #256444) requires a throwaway spike before full UI implementation
- [Phase 5]: tree-sitter-java and tree-sitter-cpp WASM compatibility with web-tree-sitter@0.25.x is unvalidated — may require custom WASM builds or deferring Java/C++ support
- [Phase 7]: Cloud relay operational model (hosting platform, cost model, self-host option) is not yet decided — needs decision before Phase 7 planning
- [Phase 8]: VS Code MCP API is new (2025) — McpStdioServerDefinition vs McpHttpServerDefinition tradeoffs need research during Phase 8 planning
