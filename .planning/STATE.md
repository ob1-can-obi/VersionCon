# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04)

**Core value:** Teams collaborate on code without merge conflict pain — dependency-aware tracking means you only stop coding when changes genuinely affect what you're working on.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — extension-foundation-lan-networking

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (extension-foundation-lan-networking) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 8
Status: Executing Phase 01 — Plan 00 complete
Last activity: 2026-05-04 -- Plan 01-00 complete (test infrastructure stubs)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 12%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 0.03 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-00 (2 min)
- Trend: starting

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Use `web-tree-sitter` (WASM) from day one — never `node-tree-sitter`. Switching later requires rewriting entire AST layer.
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Manual IP join path must be built BEFORE mDNS discovery. mDNS fails silently in VLANs and corporate/university networks.
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Stateless webview architecture — all state in extension host; webview fires `webview-ready` on mount and receives full state snapshot.
- [Pre-Phase 2]: Route drag-and-drop events through extension host to avoid VS Code 1.90+ cross-webview regression (issue #256444).
- [Plan 01-00]: Test stubs created as Wave 0 before production code — every requirement tagged in test descriptions for traceability.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Cross-webview drag-and-drop VS Code 1.90+ regression (issue #256444) requires a throwaway spike before full UI implementation
- [Phase 5]: tree-sitter-java and tree-sitter-cpp WASM compatibility with web-tree-sitter@0.25.x is unvalidated — may require custom WASM builds or deferring Java/C++ support
- [Phase 7]: Cloud relay operational model (hosting platform, cost model, self-host option) is not yet decided — needs decision before Phase 7 planning
- [Phase 8]: VS Code MCP API is new (2025) — McpStdioServerDefinition vs McpHttpServerDefinition tradeoffs need research during Phase 8 planning
